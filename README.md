# nextjs-basic-auth-middleware

Adds basic auth to a NextJS project on a document level.
Options can be set on the basic auth middleware and overriden using environment variables.

This project was bootstrapped with [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx).

## Installation

Run either of the following commands to add the package, based on your package manager of choice:

```sh
# NPM
npm install nextjs-basic-auth-middleware

# Yarn
yarn add nextjs-basic-auth-middleware
```

## Usage
Add the middleware to the `getInitialProps` method of your document:

```js
    Document.getInitialProps = async ({req, res}) => {
        await basicAuthMiddleware(req, res)
        ...
    }
```

### Setting environment variables
If you want to override credentials you can use the `BASIC_AUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:

```sh
# Enables basic auth for user `test` with password `password`
BASIC_AUTH_CREDENTIALS=user:password

# You can set multiple accounts using `|` as a delimiter
BASIC_AUTH_CREDENTIALS=user:password|user2:password2
```

Users set using environment variables will override and thus disable users set in options.
You can also set the paths that should (not) be checked:

```sh
# Enables basic authentication for /pages
BASIC_AUTH_PATHS=/pages

# You can set multiple paths using `;` as a delimiter
BASIC_AUTH_PATHS=/pages;/admin

# Setting excluded paths work in the same way
BASIC_AUTH_EXCLUDE_PATHS=/api;/healthchecks
```

## API
### basicAuthMiddleware()
```basicAuthMiddleware(reg: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse, options)```

The options object can contain any of the following options:

option | description | default value
------ | ----------- | -------------
`realm`| The name of the basic auth realm | `'Protected'`
`users`| A list of users that can authenticate | `[]`
`includePaths`| List of paths that should have protection | `['/']`
`excludePaths`| List of paths that are excluded from protection | `[]`

> **NOTE**
> The exclude paths are always excluded from protection,
> even if they exist in the included paths

The user object consists of the following required fields:

field | description | type
----- | ----------- | ----
`name`| The username | `string`
`password`| The password | `string`


## Local Development

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development/watch mode. Your project will be rebuilt upon changes. TSDX has a special logger for your convenience. Error messages are pretty printed and formatted for compatibility VS Code's Problems tab.

Your library will be rebuilt if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder.
The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
